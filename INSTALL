In order to install VEC, you will need to:

  - copy the vec.vim file and the vec/ directory from the src/ directory to
    your vim plugin directory

  - copy the vec.txt file from the doc/ directory in your vim documentation
    directory (usually /usr/local/share/vim/vim61/doc) then use :helptags
    vimdocs (replacing "vimdocs" with the path to your vim documentation
    directory)

  - edit your .vimrc file and add

      let $VECHOME = "$HOME/.vim/plugin/"

    replacing "$HOME/.vim/plugin/" with your vim plugin directory
